# Launcher-OnePlus
Customizable and Open Source Launcher for Android.

### Description

This is an open source launcher project for Android devices that has been built completely from scratch. The main goal of this launcher is to find a healthy medium between customization and simplicity. At this point in time it implements most features required in a typical launcher but could benefit greatly from some general polish. If you would like to help out feel free to submit issues or ask about submitting a pull request with a feature you want to see in the launcher.
